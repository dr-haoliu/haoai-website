# HaoAI Receives 2025 NSF Grant for AI-Powered Disease Diagnosis

We are thrilled to announce that the HaoAI research team has been awarded a prestigious National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to develop cutting-edge agentic AI systems for early disease detection and personalized treatment recommendations.

## About the Grant

The three-year, $1.5 million grant will support our research into:

1. **Multi-agent AI systems** that can autonomously gather and analyze patient data from multiple sources
2. **Early disease prediction** using advanced machine learning algorithms
3. **Personalized treatment recommendations** based on individual patient profiles and medical histories
4. **Explainable AI frameworks** to ensure trust and transparency in clinical decision-making

## Significance

"This grant represents a significant milestone for our team and for the field of AI in healthcare," said Dr. Hao Liu, Principal Investigator. "Our agentic AI approach will enable more accurate and timely diagnoses, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs."

## Collaborating Institutions

The project will be conducted in collaboration with:

- Montclair State University (Lead Institution)
- Stanford University School of Medicine
- Columbia University Data Science Institute

## Timeline

- **Phase 1** (Months 1-12): System architecture design and prototype development
- **Phase 2** (Months 13-24): Clinical validation and iterative improvement
- **Phase 3** (Months 25-36): Pilot deployment and real-world testing

## Impact

This research has the potential to:
- Reduce diagnostic errors by up to 30%
- Decrease time-to-diagnosis for serious conditions
- Enable more personalized and effective treatment planning
- Provide decision support for healthcare providers, especially in underserved areas

## Next Steps

Our team is actively recruiting research assistants and postdoctoral researchers to work on this exciting project. Interested candidates should contact Dr. Hao Liu at hliu@montclair.edu.
